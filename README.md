# Scoring system for a tennis tournament

The scoring system for tennis works like this:

* A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.

* The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as 0, 15, 30, 40, respectively

* If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "deuce".

* If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead.

Constraints

* We're just worried about one game, don't worry about sets, tie breakers, etc
* Don't worry about validation, assume the client passes in correct data

For example:


The interface will look something like this in Ruby:

```ruby
  game = Game.new("player 1", "player 2")
  game.point_won_by("player 1")
  game.point_won_by("player 2")
  // this will return "15-15"
  game.score

  game.point_won_by("player 1")
  game.point_won_by("player 1")
  // this will return "40-15"
  game.score

  game.point_won_by("player 2")
  game.point_won_by("player 2")
  // this will return "Deuce"
  game.score

  game.point_won_by("player 1")
  // this will return "Advantage player 1"
  game.score

  game.point_won_by("player 1")
  // this will return "Player 1 wins"
  game.score
```
